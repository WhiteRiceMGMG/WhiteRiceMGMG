# About Me

I'm an embedded systems engineer specializing in low-level software development for automotive applications.
My primary programming language is C, and I work on designing and implementing real-time, memory-efficient firmware for in-vehicle systems.
I'm particularly proficient in bare-metal programming, microcontroller-based development, and Linux-based embedded environments, with a strong focus on performance optimization and hardware-software integration.
